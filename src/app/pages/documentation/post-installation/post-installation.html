      Upon booting into Oreon Linux for the first time, log in with the user
      account you created during installation. You might be greeted by the GNOME
      Initial Setup utility (or a similar welcome screen for other potential
      desktop environments). Follow the prompts to configure language, keyboard
      settings (if needed), privacy options, and connect online accounts
      (optional). This setup usually runs only once.

        It's crucial to update your system immediately after installation to get
        the latest security patches, bug fixes, and software improvements.

          Review the list of packages to be updated. Type `y` and press Enter to
          confirm and proceed with the download and installation. This process
          might take some time depending on the number of updates and your
          internet speed. It's a good practice to reboot your system after
          applying major updates, especially if the kernel or system libraries
          were updated:

        Verify hardware drivers
      </h2>
      <p class="text-gray-600">
        Oreon Linux aims to provide excellent hardware support out-of-the-box.
        However, it's good to check if all your hardware components (graphics
        card, Wi-Fi adapter, etc.) are working correctly.
      </p>
    </div>

    <p>
      <b>Graphics:</b> Check your display resolution and ensure graphical
      effects are smooth. For NVIDIA or AMD GPUs, Oreon may offer proprietary
      drivers via its own repositories or integrated third-party sources like
      RPM Fusion. Check the Software Center or system settings for "Additional
      Drivers". <br /><b>Wi-Fi & Bluetooth:</b> Ensure you can connect to
      wireless networks and pair Bluetooth devices if needed. <br /><b

        Enable additional repositories (if applicable)
      </h2>
      <p class="text-gray-600">
        While Oreon Linux provides a solid base, some software (like multimedia
        codecs or proprietary drivers) might reside in third-party repositories.
        Oreon might pre-configure access to popular repositories like RPM
        Fusion, or provide an easy way to enable them.
      </p>
    </div>

    <p>
      Check the Oreon documentation specific to your version or look for options
      within the Software Center or system settings to enable third-party
      repositories if they aren't enabled by default. The RPM Fusion repository
      is a common source for packages not included in standard RHEL/Fedora-based
      distributions due to licensing or patent reasons. If Oreon doesn't include
      it, you might enable it manually (check the RPM Fusion website for
      instructions specific to your RHEL base version, e.g., RHEL 9 for Oreon
      Lime). After enabling new repositories, run `sudo dnf update` again to
      refresh the package lists.
