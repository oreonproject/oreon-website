        Overview
      </h2>
    </div>
    <p>
      The Oreon Software Center provides a user-friendly graphical interface for
      managing software on your system. It serves as a storefront, allowing you
      to browse, search, install, update, and remove applications easily. Under
      the hood, it typically utilizes the system's package manager (dnf) and may
      also integrate with other packaging formats like Flatpak, offering access
      to a wide range of software from various sources.

        browsing and searching
      </h2>
    </div>
    <p>
      The main view of the Software Center usually presents featured
      applications and categories (such as Audio & Video, Graphics &
      Photography, Office, Developer Tools, Games, etc.). You can click on these
      categories to explore related software. A prominent search bar at the top
      allows you to quickly find applications by typing their name or keywords
      related to their function. Search results update dynamically as you type.

        Installing applications
      </h2>
    </div>
    <p>
      When you select an application from the browse view or search results, you
      are taken to its details page. This page typically shows the application's
      name, icon, description, screenshots, version number, license, and
      sometimes user reviews or ratings. To install the application, simply
      click the prominent "Install" button. You will likely be prompted to enter
      your user password to authorize the system change. The Software Center
      will then download and install the application and any necessary
      dependencies, showing a progress indicator.

        Updating software
      </h2>
    </div>
    <p>
      Keeping your system and applications up-to-date is crucial. The Software
      Center typically includes an "Updates" section or tab. It automatically
      checks for available updates periodically and will display a list of
      packages (including applications and system components) that have newer
      versions available. You can review the updates and click an "Update All"
      or similar button to apply them. Individual updates might also be
      selectable. Password authentication is usually required for applying
      updates.

        Software sources / repositories
      </h2>
    </div>
    <p>
      The applications available in the Software Center come from configured
      software repositories. These are servers containing packages specifically
      built and tested for Oreon and its base distribution. Additionally,
      Oreon's Software Center might be configured to use Flatpak, a universal
      packaging system. This often includes integration with Flathub, a large
      repository of Flatpak applications, significantly expanding the available
      software selection. Flatpak applications run in a sandboxed environment,
      which can enhance security.
